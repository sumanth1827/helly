This was a game that I made in about a day's time. It was initially intended to be a WebGL game but due to hosting issues, was made into a pc game. I am also considering making it compatible with android and iOS. It takes inspiration from the popular game - flappy-bird while adding a different dynamic and layer to it. Please play it and and constructive feedback will be appriciated.
